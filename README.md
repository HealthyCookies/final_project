# Healthy Cookies

## Description

Welcome to the HealthyCookies repository.
This project is an app designed to help people track their food intake and make it easier to calculate their daily calorie intake to become healthier.
Our app doesn't need internet access and everything is stored on the user's phone in cookies. That's why we chose the name HealthyCookies.
